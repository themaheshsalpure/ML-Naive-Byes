# Naive Bayes Classifier
# Overview
Welcome to the Naive Bayes Classifier repository! This repository contains implementations of various Naive Bayes classifiers that I have learned and experimented with. Naive Bayes is a popular machine learning algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and text classification.

# Algorithms Implemented
Gaussian Naive Bayes: Suitable for classification tasks with continuous features that follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Primarily used for text classification tasks where features represent the frequency of words in a document.
Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Effective for binary feature classification, often used in text classification tasks with binary features.
